It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. You are the only mystery worth solving. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! Brave heart, Clara. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. Bow ties are cool.

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. I never know why. I only know who. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Goodbye, Clara. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day. Come along, Pond! Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted.
